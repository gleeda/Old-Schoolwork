METAL is a POC shim library for memory encryption.  It is given
``As-is'' with no warranty whatsoever.  There is still a lot of work to
be done on this project.  Input is appreciated and can be sent to me at:

There is a make file.

make all 
    creates the libmetal.so* library

make install
    installs the library under /usr/lib by default.  one must be root
    in order to install in /usr/lib.  this can be changed to some other
    preference of course.


In order to use METAL with legacy applications you can use the following
command:

    $ LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libmetal.so" [application_cmd]

where you will replace [application_cmd] with the program you intend to
run.

You can also compile applications with the -lmetal flag after it is
installed, or you can use the library without installing in /usr/lib 
by using the following commands:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Then to compile [assuming you messed with the path, as above]:

    $ cc -fPIC -c main.c
    $ cc main.o -L. -lmetal -o test -pthread

TODO: make the pthread mutex inline.
